I googled for example codes that sends serial data from Processing to Arduino,
(not from Arduino to Processing...Arduino even contains it as example code)
so I tried one.

Sample Processing code uses controlP5 library, 
so if you are new to it, please refer to http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/
